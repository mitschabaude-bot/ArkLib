# List preimages outside the MCA event

A code determined by the agreement threshold has exact list preimages outside MCA.
The conclusion concerns the entire agreement set and works for interleaved module codes.

/-- Every nearby generated codeword has simultaneous codeword preimages outside MCA.
Determination at the radius threshold makes their generated combination exactly the candidate;
their common agreement set is exactly its agreement set with the generated received word. -/
